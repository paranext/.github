Paranext is an effort to develop the next generation of technologies for [Paratext](https://paratext.org) and its Bible translation user base. This includes
 * [Paratext 10 Studio](https://paratextstudio.org), the successor to Paratext 9 and
 * [Platform](https://platform.bible), the extensible, open-source, collaborative framework upon which it's built.
