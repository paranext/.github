Paranext is an effort to develop the next generation of technologies for [Paratext](https://paratext.org) and its Bible translation user base. This includes
 * [Paratext 10 Studio](https://paratextstudio.org), the successor to Paratext 9 and
 * [Platform](https://platform.bible), the extensible, open-source, collaborative framework upon which it's built.

See [/paranext-core/](https://github.com/paranext/paranext-core) for instructions on running Platform. For everything else, see [paranext-core/wiki/](https://github.com/paranext/paranext-core/wiki/Platform.Bible-and-Paratext-10-Studio).
